<h1>💌 Our Story</h1>
<p class="subtitle">Future and Forever ❤️</p>

<p>At the gym… You helped me with a tricep dips workout and that’s when I noticed you.
We slowly started talking and texting, and I fell for how gentle and respectful you were.
You said you loved my simplicity in the way I smile, laugh, talk and even the way I look.</p>

<hr>

<p>Our first time meeting alone felt like destiny itself.
It was Eid and Ugadi on the same day!!
I gave you 5 star chocolate and you brought me Sheer Khurma.
And there we were… meeting for the first time alone in the gym parking.</p>

<p>Our first long conversation lasted the whole night until morning
and somehow, it never felt tiring.</p>

<hr>

<p><b>11th April 2025, 11pm</b><br>
A dark quiet street… me in the driver’s seat… you beside me.
You held my hand… and said,
<b>"Mujhe I Love You bolna tha"</b> ❤️</p>

<p>Aur khushi se maine kaha,
<b>"Yes... I love you too! Obviously!"</b> ❤️</p>

<hr>

<p>Our first cute meet at the metro station…
concert day "whisper"… scooty rides… office, steps, lift moments!
My "No" and your "Please". From "This is not our..." to "Hehe". 
We were two shy love birds to now forever together.</p>

<hr>

<p>We do fight a lot… but always run back to each other.
And in every life, I will still choose you ❤️ And I know you will too ❤️ </p>
